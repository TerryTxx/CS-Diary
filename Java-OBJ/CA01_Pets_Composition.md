## 1. `abstract class Pet` as compared to just `class Pet`

TIPS of abstract classes(1-8)
[--tips from my study diary](https://github.com/TerryTxx/CS-Diary/blob/master/Java-OBJ/IBobj01.md)
```test
1. the abstract class itself cannot be instantiated; 
   as could not be new XXX().
```
```java
//general class
Class Per{}
new Pet();//OK

Abstract Class Per{}
new Pet();//Fail
```
```
2. abstract classes do not necessarily have to have abstract methods; no-abstract class can not have abastract methods
3. abstract methods must be in the abstract class;
4. 'abstract' can only modify classes and methods, not other attributes;
5. abstract classes can have arbitrary membersï¼Œ they are essentially classes, e.g., non-abstract methods, constructors, static attributes, etc.
7. if a class inherits from an abstract class, it must implement all the abstract methods in the abstract class, unless i it is also an abstract class.
8. abstract methods cannot use private, final and static(it make go with class out of obj) together; these keywords contradict overwriting;
```

## 2. data-types for `name` `gender` and `sound`
```java
 abstract class Pet{
        //abstract  String name;// erro, Q2--tips4:'abstract' can only modify classes and methods, not other attributes;
        private String name;// String
        private String gender;//boolean is better
                        /Q2--tips5: abstract classes can have arbitrary members,they are essentially classes,e.g., 
                     //non-abstract methods, constructors, static attributes, etc.
        private String sound;//String
     //!! getter and setter for complete the Encapsulation  
......
```
## 3. `Pet(...)` constructor options for client programmers
```java
  Pet(String name, String gender, String sound) { 
        //`Pet(...)` Constructors with three parameters covered noparameter/orginal constructor
        // Enables three properties of a class to be passed directly into an object via a constructor.
        this.name = name;
        //The name passed in by the constructor are assigned to 'name' already in this class, and 'this' indicates that the scope is in this class, locating.
                this.gender = gender;
        //The gender passed in by the constructor are assigned to 'gender' already in this class, and 'this' indicates that the scope is in this class, locating.
                this.sound = sound;
        //The 'sound' passed in by the constructor are assigned to 'sound' already in this class, and 'this' indicates that the scope is in this class, locating.
            }
            
        //!! getter and setter for complete the   Encapsulation  
```
## 4. `abstract String makeSound()` compared to just `String makeSound()` or `void makeSound()`
```java
        abstract String makeSound();//abstract method in abstract class
        String saySomething(){XXX};//general method
```

## 5.  Adding attribute `FoodThing food` with the introduction of `class FoodThing` from which `Bone` and `Fish` are derived.
```java
class FoodThing {
    String foodName;
    
    FoodThing(String foodName) {
        this.foodName = foodName;
    }

    public void feed(Pet pet) {
    //passing in a reference to Pet will derive the corresponding name against the instantiated cat or dog according to the polymorphism principle.
        if (pet != null) {
         System.out.println("Feeding " + foodName + " to " + pet.getName() + ".");
    }
}
```

## Dog.java (and equivalent for similar: Cat.java)
- `Bone bone;` with line `bone = new Bone();` (inside Dog(...) as compared to `Bone bone = new Bone();`
```html
1. firstly I modified the Bone property and getBone access to be more conducive to encapsulation and coding security.
2. checking remarks of `Bone bone;` with line `bone = new Bone();` (inside Dog(...) below
3. Bone bone = new Bone(); means creat an Object of Bone(), and have a bone assigned(=) to this newly object
```
- `Dog(...)` constructor options for client programmers
- - [check the dog.jave below](#dog-class-explaination)
- `super(name, gender, "Woof");`
- - [check the dog.jave below](#dog-class-explaination)
- `getBone()` as compared with making attribute `Dog.bone` accessible for direct access
```
1. I changed the Bone access as private, so Dog.bone could be used inner Dog only;
2. get()Bone() helps to ensure data integrity and security, reduce errors and improve code maintainability. Dog.bone could not.
```

### Dog class explaination
```java
// Dog.java
class Dog extends Pet {//Inherit an abstract class, taking care to implement the abstract methods of the parent class
    privare Bone bone;// Subclass' specific properties
       //Declare a reference variable named 'bone' of type Bone
       // accessable in Dog class only

    Dog(String name, String gender) {
        super(name, gender, "Woof");
        // super is used to call the constructor of the parent class, passing name, gender, and the string "Woof" as parameters.
        // These parameters are passed to the constructor of the parent class and are used to initialize the properties of the parent class.
       bone = new Bone();
        //Create a new instance of class Bone and point the specific reference value bone in this class to this object and get a unique address.
    }
    String makeSound() {//tips7: if a class inherits from an abstract class, it must implement all the abstract methods in the abstract class
        return "Woof";
         }//Implement parent class abstract methods

    public Bone getBone() {
        return bone;
     }//Return a reference to the 'Bone' class instance held by this class.
}
```


## Bone.java (and equivalent for similar: Fish.java)
- worthy of a class? if so why?
- attribute `printString` - worth having this or not?
```
1. If there is only one string attribute, just use the Foodstring call directly. No needs for different classes;
2. if printString is only call out this attrbute, using override toString will be mor efficient
3. But if for the sake of code robustness, Bone and Fish will have a lot of different attributes in the future, 
   we need seperate class and attributes:
    (1) through the encapsulation of different classes, and then through the inheritance of Foodstring, 
    (2) to ensure the safety and efficiency of the data and code, the call can be used to polymorphism, 
    (3) but also conducive to the maintenance of the code later.
