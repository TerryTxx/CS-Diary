```text
java provides four access modifiers that control access to methods and properties (member variables).
1. public (+): public to the outside world. 
2. protected (#): public for subclasses and classes in the same package.
3. default (no content): no written modifier, public to classes in the same package.
4. private (-): only accessible on the class itself, not public
```
### Diff table of access modifier

|    | Access Level | type      | Same Class | Same Package | sub Class | deff Pack |
|----|--------------|-----------|------------|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| 1  | public       | public    | √          | √            | √         | √         |
| 2  | protected    | protected | √          | √            | √         | X         |
| 3  | (null)       | default   | √          | √            | X         | X         |
| 4  | private      | private   | √          | X            | X         | X         |

## Examples briefly explaining how to public access a packaged class from outside the package

- using an import statement only to the packaged class
```java
// Assume the 'CA06' class is in a package called 'com.example.package'
import com.example.package.CA06;

public class Test {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
         CA06 myObject = new CA06(); // Create an instance of CA06
         // You can now use myObject to access the public methods and fields of CA06
     }
}
```
```text
The class and package is public;

In my example, CA06 is a public class located in the com.example.package package. 
By using the import statement import com.example.package.CA06;
we can now use CA06 directly in the Test class without having to specify the full package path each time reference CA06.
```
- using a variable definition only of the packaged class
```java
public class Test {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
         com.example.package.CA06 myObject = new com.example.package.CA06();
         //Create an instance of the CA06 class using its fully qualified name
         // Now you can use myObject to access the public methods and properties of the CA06 class
     }
}
```
```text
Accessing methods of a class from outside the package using variable definitions of a package class requires ensuring that the class should be public.

In my code, by using the fully qualified name of com.example.package.CA06, 
I can create an instance of the CA06 class directly in the Test class without using an import statement at the top of the file. 
This approach is useful to avoid naming conflicts or when the class is used very rarely.
```

- using a constructor/method/member of the packaged class
```java
public class Test {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
         com.example.package.CA06 myObject = new com.example.package.CA06();
         //Create an instance of CA06 through its public constructor using its fully qualified name

         myObject.publicMethod();
         // Call the public method of the CA06 class
     }
}
```
```text
In my code, I first create an instance of the CA06 class by using its fully qualified name and public constructor. 
Then, use this instance to call the publicMethod method. 
This shows how to access public constructors and methods of a class in another package from a different package. 
The same rules apply to accessing public member variables.
```


## Fully Qualified Name:
- show an example
```java
public class Test {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
         com.example.package.CA06 myObject = new com.example.package.CA06();
         // Here, 'com.example.package.CA06' is the fully qualified name
          //Includes package name and class name.
     }
}
```
- and what it's equivalent to
```java
import com.example.package.CA06;

public class Test {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
         CA06 myObject = new CA06();
         // Here, due to the use of the import statement, we only need the class name 'CA06'
    //In this equivalent example, the CA06 class is imported using an import statement at the top of the file,
    //we can then refer to it directly using the class name CA06 without writing out the fully qualified name.
   //This makes the code cleaner and easier to read, especially when we need to reference the same class multiple times.
     }
}
```


## Examples briefly comparing how package access works:

- between to classes of the same package
```java
package CA06;

class A {
     void methodA() {
         //Default access, visible in the same package
     }
}

class B {
     void methodB() {
         A a = new A();
         a.methodA(); // Can access methodA of Class A because they are in the same package
     }
}
```
- between a subclass/superclass in the same package
```java
package CA06;

class SuperClass {
     void superClassMethod() {
         //Default access, visible in the package
     }
}

class SubClass extends SuperClass {
     void subClassMethod() {
         superClassMethod(); // Accessible because SubClass and SuperClass are in the same package CA06
     }
}
```


## Examples briefly showing and explaining protected access

- distinguish protected and package access
- - [can also check my table on top](#diff-table-of-access-modifier)
```text
Protected access:
1. In the following code: protected members can be accessed by other classes in the same package CA06 and by all subclasses, even if these subclasses are in different packages.
2. Protected members can be accessed by other classes in the same package.
3. They can also be accessed by subclasses in different packages, which is a key feature of the protected access level.

Package (package-level private) access:
1. In the following code: Members without specified access modifiers are package-level private by default and can only be accessed by other classes in the same package CA06.
2. If a class member does not specify any access modifier (i.e. default access), it will have package-level private access.
3. This means that these members can only be accessed by other classes within the same package.
4. Subclasses or other classes in different packages cannot access members with these default access permissions.
```
- give an example using the term "through inheritance"
```java
package CA06;

public class SuperClass {
    protected void protectedMethod() {
        System.out.println("Protected method in SuperClass");
    }
}

package anotherPackage;

import CA06.SuperClass;

public class SubClass extends SuperClass {
    public void subClassMethod() {
        protectedMethod();  // Inheritance provides access to protected methods of the superclass
    }
}

```
