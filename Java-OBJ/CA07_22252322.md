## Part 1
Using the code provided in the Craps00.java example
(initial procedural game)
a) draw a flow chart of the execution of the code provided

b) identify on the diagram exactly where you feel
the code is not performing as it should and why

c) identify changes to get the code to perform as it should:
marks awarded for being as precise as possible
(no unnecessary code-changes proposed)
(only those **needed** to correct the execution)
```java
static void checkPlayPointGame(int rolled) {
    //Modify checkPlayPointGame to handle the initial win/lose conditions.

    if (rolled == 7 || rolled == 11) {
        System.out.println("You Win!");
        craps = true; // End game after win
    } else if (rolled == 2 || rolled == 3 || rolled == 12) {
    //Current Issue: The function sets playPointGame to false for 7, 11, 2, 3, 12 but doesn't handle win/lose scenarios.
        System.out.println("Craps! You Lose!");
        craps = true; // End game after loss
    } else {
        playPointGame = true; // Set point game for other values
    }
}

static void playPointGame() {
    if (firstTime) {
        pointValue = rollDice();
        System.out.println("Point is set to: " + pointValue);
        firstTime = false;
    } else {
        int rolled = rollDice();
        System.out.println("You rolled: " + rolled);
        if (rolled == pointValue) {//Modify playPointGame to handle the rolling of point value:
            System.out.println("You hit your point! You Win!");
            craps = true; // End game after win
        } else if (rolled == 7) {
            System.out.println("Rolled a 7! You Lose!");
            craps = true; // End game after loss
        }
    }
}
static void askPlayerToRoll(Scanner scanner) {
    System.out.println("Press Enter to Roll");
    String userInput = scanner.nextLine();
    if (!userInput.equals("")) {
        System.out.println("Quitting...");
        System.exit(-1);
    }
}

// In main method:
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
// Replace all askPlayerToRoll() calls with askPlayerToRoll(scanner);

```


Part 2
Using the code provided in the Craps01.java and Craps02.java
(OO State Pattern attempts)

a) draw a UML state-diagram or more traditional
state-transition diagram OF THE CODE PROVIDED
(i.e. you must use terms from the code provided only)
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ne9VpAIca6z9qhkgUMNmbxr4tuKR8Sh4/view?usp=sharing
b) b) identify on the diagram exactly where you feel
the code is not performing as it should and why

c) identify changes to get the code to perform as it should:
marks awarded for being as precise as possible
(no unnecessary code-changes proposed)
(only those **needed** to correct the execution)
   
```java
//Changes in GameController class:
void start(){
    // Assuming the game should end when credits reach 0 or below
    while(credits > 0){
        UIHandler.askPlayerToRoll();
        play(Dice.rollDice());
    }
    System.out.println("Game over. No more credits.");
}
//Changes in CrapsGameState subclasses:
class WinState extends CrapsGameState{
    void play(int rolled){
        System.out.println( "WinState.play() - Rolled: " + rolled );
        System.out.println( "Increase credits" );
        GameController.credits += 10; // Assuming winning adds 10 credits
        System.out.println("Credits remaining: " + GameController.credits);
        GameController.setState("CRAPS"); // Reset to initial state
    }
}
class LooseState extends CrapsGameState{
    void play(int rolled){
        System.out.println( "LooseState.play() - Rolled: " + rolled );
        System.out.println( "Decrease credits" );
        GameController.credits -= 10; // Assuming losing deducts 10 credits
        if (GameController.credits <= 0) {
            System.out.println("0 credits remaining. Game Over.");
            System.exit(0); // Exit game when no credits left
        } else {
            System.out.println("Credits remaining: " + GameController.credits);
            GameController.setState("CRAPS"); // Reset to initial state
        }
    }
}
class PointState extends CrapsGameState{
    int pointValue;

    void play(int rolled){
        System.out.println( "PointState.play() - Rolled: " + rolled );
        if( rolled == pointValue ){
            resetPointValue();
            GameController.setState("WIN");
        }else if( rolled == 7 ){
            resetPointValue();
            GameController.setState("LOOSE");
        }else{
            System.out.println("Roll again to hit your point value: " + pointValue);
            // Remaining in PointState until point value or 7 is rolled
        }
    }

    void storePointValueAs(int rolled){
        pointValue = rolled;
        System.out.println("Point value set to: " + pointValue);
    }
    void resetPointValue(){
        pointValue = 0;
    }
}
```


PART 3:
a) Analyse the code provided and briefly state
whether it is a valid implementation of the
State design-pattern.
```text
1. State interface or abstract class: The pattern should have an interface or abstract class that defines the common behavior of the possible states.
2. Concrete state class: Concrete state class based on interface or abstract class. Each class encapsulates the behavior of an object in a specific state.
3. Context class: A context class that holds a reference to a state object and allows clients or other objects to change its state.
4. State switching logic: There should be logic in the context class to change the state object it holds, usually based on some internal variable or external input.
```
b) Relate the State design pattern to another pattern
we have studied on this course to date.
It must be most similar to the other pattern you suggest.
```text
State design pattern
Application scenarios:

When an object's behavior depends on its internal state, and it needs to change its behavior at runtime based on the state.
advantage:

Encapsulating state transition logic: The state pattern simplifies state management and transition logic by encapsulating state-related behaviors in independent state objects.
Good scalability: When adding a new state, you only need to add a new state class without modifying the existing class.
Eliminate bulky conditional statements: Replace complex conditional selection structures (such as if-else) to make the code clearer.
shortcoming:

Increase the number of classes: Each state requires a corresponding class, which may lead to a rapid increase in the number of classes.
Tight coupling: State classes may be tightly coupled with context classes, making maintenance more difficult.
strategic design pattern
Application scenarios:

When a class defines multiple behaviors, and these behaviors are configured or switched in multiple ways during the operation of this class.
advantage:

Algorithm encapsulation and switching: The strategy mode defines a series of algorithms or strategies so that they can be replaced with each other at runtime.
Good scalability: new strategies can be added and modified independently of the context, complying with the opening and closing principle.
Avoid complex conditional statements: Use the strategy pattern to avoid multiple conditional selection statements.
shortcoming:

Clients must be aware of the different policies: Clients using policy mode need to understand the differences in each policy.
Increase the number of objects: The strategy pattern encapsulates each algorithm in a separate class, potentially increasing the number of objects in the system.
```




c) State how it is similar and how it is different.

```text
Encapsulating behavior: Both achieve behavioral changes by encapsulating behavior in different classes.

Context dependency: Both patterns have a context class that holds a reference to a policy or state object that can be changed at runtime.

Interchangeability: In both modes, policy or state objects are interchangeable at runtime.
difference:

Decision-making basis: "State pattern" usually changes behavior based on the internal state of the object, while "Strategy pattern" is based on different strategy objects passed to the context.

Control: In "State Pattern", control of state transitions is usually within the state object, while in "Policy Pattern", the client usually controls which strategy is selected.

Intent and usage scenarios: The state mode is mainly used when the state changes of the object lead to changes in behavior, while the strategy mode is mainly used when switching between different algorithms.
