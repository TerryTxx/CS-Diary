## the * operator (for declaring a "pointer", and for "de-referencing")
```text
Pointer declarator (at definition time): such as int *p; Always appears immediately after the type declarator and is part of the declaration;

Dereference (&): If p has been defined in advance as a pointer, such as int* p, then using *p again will be the value of the address pointed to by p. Always appears in an expression;
```
```CPP
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Pointer declarator (at definition time)
    int a = 42;
    int* p = &a; // Declare a pointer to an integer and assign the address of 'a' to it

    // Dereference (*)
    *p = 10; // Dereference 'p' and assign the value 10 to the memory location it points to
    std::cout << "The value of 'a' after dereferencing: " << a << std::endl;

    *p = 200; // Dereference 'p' again and assign the value 200 to the same memory location
    std::cout << "The updated value of 'a' after dereferencing: " << a << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
## the & operator (and two example usages)
```CPP
// EXP 1 --assign address
int a = 42;
int *ptr = &a; // Take the address of variable a and assign the address to pointer ptr
               //ptr "points to" the memory location of a.
//EXP 2 -- reference
int a = 42;
int &b = a; // Declare an integer reference b, which is an alias of variable a
            //It does not directly involve the operation of taking the address, but uses & when declaring the reference.
```
## briefly explaining the difference between a pointer and a reference in C++
```text
1. Definition method and syntax:

   Pointer: A pointer is a variable used to store a memory address. Pointers are declared and dereferenced using the * notation.

   Reference: A reference is an alias used to directly access an existing object. References are declared and defined using the & symbol.

2. Null:

   Pointer: A pointer can have a null value (nullptr), which means it does not point to any valid object.

   Reference: A reference must always refer to a valid object, it cannot be null.

3. Initialization and reassignment:

   Pointer: The pointer can be declared without initialization, or the pointed object can be changed through assignment operation.

   References: References must be initialized when declared and cannot be reassigned to reference other objects.

4. Space occupied:

   Pointer: The pointer itself needs to occupy a certain amount of memory space to store the address.

   Reference: A reference does not occupy additional memory space, it is just an alias of an existing object.
```
```CPP
#include <iostream>

void pointerExample() {
     int value = 42;
     int* ptr = &value; // pointer to value

     std::cout << "Pointer value: " << *ptr << std::endl; // Dereference pointer
     *ptr = 99; // Modify the value pointed by the pointer

     std::cout << "Modified value: " << value << std::endl;
}

void referenceExample() {
     int value = 42;
     int& ref = value; // reference of value

     std::cout << "Reference value: " << ref << std::endl; // Direct access to reference
     ref = 99; // Modify the value referenced by the reference

     std::cout << "Modified value: " << value << std::endl;
}

int main() {
     pointerExample();
     referenceExample();

     return 0;
}
```
