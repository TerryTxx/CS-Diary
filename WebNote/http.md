      // 1. What is front-end and back-end communication
      // The process of data interaction between front-end and back-end
      // The process of data interaction between the browser and the server

      // 2. Sending data from the back-end to the front-end
      // Accessing pages

      // 3. Sending data from the front-end to the back-end
      // User registration

      // 4. The process of front and back-end communication
      // Communication between the front and back ends is done in a 'request-response' process

      // 5. Explanation of concepts
      // Front-end: the browser side
      // Client side: anything that can communicate with the server is called a client side
      // Command line tools
      // curl https:www.google.com

      // back-end: server-side

      // 6. Accessing a web page using a browser
      // Type the URL in the address bar of your browser and press enter

      // 7. HTML tags
      // When the browser parses the HTML tags, it will send another request to the server when it encounters some special tags
      // link/img/script/iframe

      // There are also tags that the browser parses without sending a request to the server, but the user can use them to send a request to the server
      // a/form

      // 8. Ajax and Fetch

      // 1. What is HTTP
      // HyperText Transfer Protocol
      // HTML: HyperText Markup Language

      // Hypertext: A single text is linked together by hyperlinks. From the original single text into an infinitely extendable and expandable hypertext, three-dimensional text

      // HTML, JS, CSS, images, fonts, audio, video, etc. are all transferred between the server and the browser via HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

      // Each time the front-end and back-end communicate, the front-end needs to actively send a request to the back-end, and the back-end receives the request from the front-end and can give a response
      // HTTP is a request-response protocol

      // 2. HTTP request-response process
      // https://www.google.com

      // 3. What is an HTTP message
      // When the browser sends a request to the server, the request itself is the message, called the request message
      // When the server sends a response to the browser, the information transmitted is called the response message.

      // 4. HTTP message format
      // Request
      // Request header: start line + first part
      // Request body

      // GET request, there is no request body, the data is carried in the request header
      // POST request, with request body, data is carried in request body

      // Response
      // Response header: start line + first part
      // response body
